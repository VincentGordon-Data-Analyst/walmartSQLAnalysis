# Walmart Sales Performance Analysis


## Description
This project analyzes Walmart's sales performance across three states (Georgia, Virginia, and Washington) from 2001 to 2015. The report identifies sales growth trends and provides region-specific product profitability strategies to enhance Walmart’s sales and profitability.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this analysis, you need the following:
-  MySQL or a similar relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and analyze sales data.
-  Python (with libraries like pandas, SQLAlchemy, matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization).
-  Basic knowledge of SQL queries for data extraction and transformation.
-  Jupyter notebook or any Python IDE for running the analysis.

## Installing
1. Install MySQL Workbench or any preferred RDBMS to manage the walmartsales database.
2. Install Python and necessary libraries: pip install pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib
3. Download the data and ensure it’s in .csv format, as MySQL requires CSV files for importing data.
4. Import the CSV data into the database using the MySQL Workbench.
5. Connect to the database using Python's SQLAlchemy to run queries and extract data.

## Running the Tests
### Breakdown of Tests
The tests and analysis conducted include:
Sales Growth Analysis: 
- A time series analysis of Walmart’s sales growth from 2001 to 2015 across Georgia, Virginia, and Washington.
- SQL queries are used to fetch the data for each state.
- A graph is plotted to visualize the sales growth over the years.
Product Profitability Analysis:
-   Identification of high-performing products in different regions.
-   Products with the highest profit in the East, South, West, and Central regions are analyzed and highlighted.
Operational Challenges:
- Tests around data conversion (from Excel to CSV) and the handling of column names with spaces and special characters.

Deployment
